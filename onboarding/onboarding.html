      <h1>Identity Chooser</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to version 4 of Identity Chooser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you remember the first time you accidentally sent a work
        related email from your private email account?  Identity
        Chooser helps you to prevent that. It makes choosing the
        sender address explicit: Every time you'll create a new
        message, Identity Chooser shows you a menu with all your
        identities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything in Identity Chooser is about making explicit
        choices. No automatisms, no defaults.
      </p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever you open an email editor to write a new email,
          reply to a message in your inbox or forward something to a
          friend, Identity Chooser will open a window to force you to
          choose your sender address before it let's you access the
          email editor.
        </p>

        <p>
          This workflow works every time and everywhere when
          Thunderbird opens a new message. This means, Identity
          Chooser doesn't only work in the main window; it also is
          active when you create a new email directly out of the
          address book, for instance.
        </p>

        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
          Identity Chooser is very configurable:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>It let's you decide when it is active (write, reply and/or forward),</li>
          <li>You can you rearrange the order of your email adresses and</li>
          <li>Hide the address you don't want to see at all</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          If you want to show a colorful border around the "+ New
          Message" window, so you can tell different identities
          apart, I recommend the
          addon <a href='https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/bordercolors-d/'>Border
            Colors D</a>. Identity Chooser detects an installed copy
          of Border Colors D and integrates with it intelligently.

      <h2>Thank you!</h2>
      <p>
        I've been working on Identity Chooser since 2010, making
        changes and improvements. I couldn't have done it without
        your support.
      </p>

      <p>
